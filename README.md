# Dockerized php server with vscode debugging üêã

I hate php installation so here it is a prepared server to test things.

You just have to do: 

```docker compose up```

And if you want to debug it with vscode you can use this link:

[http://localhost:8080/?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1](http://localhost:8080/?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1)


I got this from [here](https://blog.devsense.com/2019/debugging-php-on-docker-with-visual-studio-code)

Enjoy!
